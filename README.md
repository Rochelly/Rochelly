  My name is Rochelly, and I am an Information Technology Analyst in the federal public service, specializing in computer networks. I have a master's degree in Science, Mathematics, and Technology Education. I am passionate about Linux, especially the Debian distribution. I use Python for data science and to develop tools that facilitate network management. I firmly believe in the importance of collaboration and open-source contributions for the advancement of the developer community. In my free time, I explore new technologies and improve my programming skills.
